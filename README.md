## Welcome to **horloge project**

**horloge** is another and a quite simple analog clock on screen with the
complete event transparency featuture.

Mouse and keyboards don't affect **horloge**, although it tries to keep on top
of any other application, all events are ignored, so the underlying application
will receive key presses, mouse clicks, drags, etc.

It uses Qt broadly.

Enjoy!
